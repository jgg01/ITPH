Thanks to https://www.driftingruby.com/episodes/fullcalendar-events-and-scheduling who created a great starting point for including Fullcalendar.io in our app!

In the Potter's Hands hopes to provide counseling and community to those who need it.

Currently, scheduling of appointments and reminders are done manually by counselors through phone calendars. Booking appointments using multiple non-communicating calendars is arduous, error prone, and ultimately unsustainable as ITPH grows. We hope to provide ITPH a central app through which appointments can be booked on a master calendar, appointment reminders will be sent to clients automatically, and provide client information and forms.
